## Portofolio Project
In this section I will provide a list of project data that I have worked on during college using various analysis methods.

### Analisis Genre Musik dan Faktor Keputusan Berlangganan Premium Aplikasi Musik pada Mahasiswa TSD
**Code:** [Classification and Association Rules Mining](https://github.com/vidyaana22/portofolio-dataanalyst/blob/main/Analisis%20Genre%20Musik%20dan%20Faktor%20Keputusan%20Berlangganan%20Premium%20Aplikasi%20Musik%20pada%20Mahasiswa%20Teknologi%20Sains%20Data.ipynb)
**Description:** The dataset was obtained from primary data resulting from research on science and technology student data. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, handling outliers, handling imbalanced data, classification modeling with imbalanced data and handling imbalances using some traditional machine learning, creating evaluation metrics, and implementing association rules.
Skills: data preprocessing, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization, classification modelling, association rules mining, evaluation metrics.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
Results: classify premium music application subscription decisions for TSD students and provide recommendations for music genres that suit students' interests.

### Analisis Clustering pada Dataset Automobile
**Code:** [Clustering Automobile](https://github.com/vidyaana22/portofolio-dataanalyst/blob/main/Clustering%20on%20Automobile%20Dataset.ipynb)
**Description:** The data contains 205 observations with 15 variables. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, clustering modelling using hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering method.
Skills: data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualization, clustering modelling.
Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy.
Results: grouping car prices based on factors that influence them.
